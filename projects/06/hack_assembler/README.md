# HackAssembler

The Assembler translates Hack assembly code (.asm) into binary machine code (.hack) that can be executed by the Hack CPU. It processes symbolic and numeric instructions, converting them into the corresponding 16-bit binary instructions. This is a key step in bridging the gap between human-readable assembly and executable machine code.
