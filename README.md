# Nand2Tetris

This repository contains my solutions for Part 1 of the **Nand2Tetris** course. The whole course walks through the process of building a modern computer from first principles, starting with basic logic gates (NAND) and culminating in a simple operating system. Part 1 covers the construction of a hardware platform, including an ALU, CPU, and a virtual machine, all simulated in HDL. It also covers creating an assembler, translating Hack assembly code to binary machine code [see my implementation](https://github.com/robinch/nand2tetris/tree/main/projects/06/hack_assembler).
